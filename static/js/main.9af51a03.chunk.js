Council of the University of Stellenbosch adopted a new language policy in 2016. The University\u2019s previous policy, adopted in 2014, established English and Afrikaans as languages of instruction (with interpretation). Compared to the 2016 Policy, the 2014 Policy would have cost an additional R640 million in infrastructure, plus about R78 million per year thereafter, entailing a 20% increase in fees (R8100 on top of the approximately R40 000 per year per student). The 2016 Policy makes teaching primarily English: teaching is in both English and Afrikaans \u2018where reasonably practicable and pedagogically sound\u2019 (parallel medium); and where demand is insufficient and recourses do not permit, only Afrikaans translations are provided, coupled with questions and answers in Afrikaans (as opposed to real-time interpreting). At the time of the judgment, Afrikaans was still offered on large scale at undergraduate level; all first-year lectures continue to be offered in Afrikaans; any student could be taught in English.\\n\\n<p>Following an extensive and exhaustive process, and in the wake of Fees Must Fall and Open Stellenbosch upheavals on its campus in 2015, the University of Stellenbosch adopted a new language policy in 2016 under the Higher Education Act and the National Language Policy for Higher Education (LPHE) to replace its 2014 policy which would have cost the University millions more Rands in infrastructure and annual operational costs, resulting in fee increases. The 2016 Policy makes teaching primarily English: teaching is in both English and Afrikaans; and where demand is insufficient and recourses do not permit, only Afrikaans translations are provided, coupled with questions and answers in Afrikaans. </p>\\n\\n<p>The Court upheld the 2016 Policy which was challenged under both section 29(2) and section 6 of the Constitution, ruling that it validly replaced the 2014 Policy which was not reasonably practicable as determined by the University.</p>\\n\\n<p>The Court ruled, in respect of the section 6 challenge, that Afrikaans did not suffer \u2018historically diminished use and status\u2019 and therefore not qualify as a disadvantaged indigenous language in terms of section 6(2), even though it did qualify as indigenous; it only qualifies and is protected as an official language under <b>section 6(4)</b>.</p> \\n\\n<p>The state has a much wider margin under <b>section 6(4)</b> than under <b>section 6(2)</b>. Under <b>section 6(2)</b>, the state is obliged to advance historically diminished languages through \u2018practical and positive measures\u2019 without disregarding the official languages under <b>section 6(4)</b>. However, under <b>section 6(4)</b>, the state is only required to treat the official languages listed equitably by not diminishing them. This means that the state cannot disregard the official languages and is obliged to conserve them, but not at the expense of corrective, advancement measures under section 6(2).</p>\\n\\n<p>Ultimately, the Court acknowledged that whilst the world was growing more hostile to minority languages, it was not the University\u2019s burden to prevent the decline of Afrikaans across South African tertiary institutions.</p>\\n\\n<p>Moegoeng CJ concurred separately, emphasizing emphasized the need to develop all indigenous languages including the spoken languages of the First Nation people.

A learner, taking part in a voluntary (non-compulsory) cultural and religious practice, pierced her nose and returned to school after the holidays wearing a nose stud, in contravention of the School Code of Conduct. After consultation between the parties, and between the School and experts, the School ultimately refused to allow her to continue wearing the nose stud and sought to enforce its Code of Conduct against her through conducting a disciplinary hearing.

The ban extended to any other piercings, including nose studs. A learner, taking part in a voluntary (non-compulsory) cultural and religious practice, pierced her nose and returned to school after the holidays wearing a nose stud, in contravention of the School Code of Conduct. Does the refusal of the school \u2013 in enforcing uniformity under the terms of its Code of Conduct, to which the learner consented through her parent upon admission to the school \u2013 amount to unfair discrimination and/or a violation of the learner\u2019s cultural and religious rights under sections 9 and 31 of the Constitution respectively? The Constitutional Court found that the refusal amounted to a violation of those rights; and that schools must reasonably accommodate differences and diversity in their communities. The Court found that it was legitimate (in general) for schools to promote uniformity in aiming to establish a disciplined school environment, but that exceptions (reasonable accommodations) must be allowed where demanded by the Constitution \u2013 as determined through a balancing of rights and interests. The Court ordered the School to amend its Code of Conduct to provide for exemption procedures allowing learners, on genuine cultural or religious grounds, to apply for permission to deviate from the uniform and other standards and requirements of the Code of Conduct, thereby allowing for the rights and interests to be weighed and balanced in the specific circumstances on a case-by-case basis.</p>\\n\\n<p>The Court noted that whilst uniforms and school rules serve an important purpose in education, the case was not about uniforms in general, but about a specific exemption to a uniform.

His argument lay in the fact that the Public Protector was not a judge and could not be afforded the same power to have binding remedial actions.\\n\\n<p>The Public Protector (third respondent) in terms of her powers investigated allegations of improper conduct and irregular expenditure regarding the security upgrades done to the private residence of the second respondent. After conducting her investigation, the Public Protector concluded that the second respondent had acted contrary to the Constitution because he had knowingly benefited from the irregular expenditure of State resources. The Public Protector then directed that the second respondent pay back the portion of the undue benefit that had benefitted him and his family. In addition to this, the Public Protector directed that the second respondent would have to reprimand the Ministers that were involved in the project for acting inappropriately.</p>\\n\\n<p>The Court emphasised that the office of the Public Protector was created to strengthen democracy and as such, it is impartial and subject only to the Constitution and the law. The Public Protector derived its powers from the Constitution primarily and the Public Protector Act did not take away nor did it substitute any of the powers vested in the Public Protector by the Constitution. Instead, the Public Protector Act enhanced the powers afforded to the Public Protector under the Constitution. Making recommendations that may be disregarded was held by the court to be inconsistent with ss 11 and 182 of the Constitution which govern the Public Protector. The court held that there was a safeguard to the remedial powers of the Public Protector because the remedial actions decided by the Public Protector were open to being challenged in court. Lastly, not all remedial actions would be binding but the context of the case would determine the legal status of the remedial action.</p>\\n\\n<p>The primary source of the power to take remedial action was the Constitution and the Public Protector Act was a secondary source. This remedial power can only be exercised against people that the Public Protector is by law allowed to investigate. The Public Protector is empowered to decide on the appropriate remedial action to be taken and how the action must be implemented. Context, nature, and language would be used to determine whether remedial action is binding or not.</p>\\n\\n<p>The main dissenting views in the case were regarding the legal status of the remedial powers that lay with the Public Protector.  The second respondent argued that compliance with the Public Protectors remedial action was optional. The remedial action was never intended to be binding on the person being investigated as the Public Protector was not a judicial officer. It was also argued that the Public Protector Act watered down the powers of the Public Protector in particular the remedial powers. On the other hand, it was argued that in the case of the Public Protector handing down an unfavourable remedial action, the person investigated had no option but to comply with the action. A remedial action could not serve as a remedy to an injured party unless it was able to deal with the matter. Therefore, the power to take remedial action would be rendered useless if the person against whom the remedial action is taken could ignore that action.</p>\\n","snippet":"<h1>Test Heading </h1><em>The case</em>concerned the legal status of the remedial powers that are vested in the Public Protector after the second respondent failed to comply with the remedial action taken against him.

It is also important to note that in the process, the Constitutional Court heard various submissions on the final constitutional text by political parties and other civil bodies and as elaborated further below the Constitutional Court found that the draft constitutional text did not comply in all aspects with the constitutional principles and referred it back to the Constitutional Assembly.</p>\\n\\n<p>The  Constitutional Court, was tasked with certifying the final constitutional text and the Court had to determine whether the constitutional text complied with the 34 constitutional principles in Schedule 4 of the Interim Constitution. The Constitutional Court\u2019s judgment was divided in eight chapters, ranging from the context of the certification process, the interpretation of the constitutional principles to the application and interpretation of the Bill of Rights and provincial and local Government powers.</p>\\n\\n<p>There were certain serious concerns raised by the Constitutional Court in measuring the final text against the constitutional principles. One of the concerns involved the safeguarding and protection of the independence of the Public-Protector and the Auditor-General which did not comply with Constitutional Principle CP XXIX, relating to the independence of the Public Service Commission, the Reserve Bank, an Auditor General and a Public Protector. The Constitutional Court also emphasised that the independence and impartiality of the Public Protector is critical to ensuring an accountable and effective government. As stated above the constitutional text was referred back to the Constitutional Assembly for further amendments.</p>\\n\\n<p>In the Constitution, <b>section 1</b> refers to the founding values of the Constitution. These values emphasise that the Republic of South Africa is \u201cone, sovereign, democratic state\u201d which is founded on various core value such as human dignity, non-racialism, supremacy of the Constitution and a multi-party system of democratic governance. It is perhaps critical before briefly summarising the Constitutional Court\u2019s views on these values in the judgment to highlight that these founding values form the foundation of our constitutional order and in terms of the Constitution numerous requirements need to be met to amend these provisions.</p>\\n\\n<p>Turning to the Constitutional Court judgment, the Court emphasised that it is necessary to identify the basic structures of our new constitutional order and it was the first question the Court was faced with on certifying the final constitutional text against the <b>34 constitutional principles</b>. The Constitutional Court emphasised that these structures include \u201ca constitutional democracy based on the supremacy of the Constitution protected by an independent judiciary\u201d which aligns with Constitutional principles IV, VII and XV. Furthermore, the Constitutional court emphasised the need for a \u201crepresentative government embracing multi-party democracy, a common voters\u2019 roll and, in general, proportional representation\u201d.

The applicants had signed contracts for the two children with the respondent. In these contracts was a clause that allowed the respondent to cancel the contract at any time, for any reason as long as a full term\u2019s written notice was given. \\n\\n<p>After a series of incidents where the applicants behaved inappropriately in front of young children, the respondent terminated the applicants\u2019 contracts with a written full-term notice. The applicants then proceeded to approach the High Court for an interim order whilst they sought to have the termination of their contract with the respondent cancelled.</p>\\n\\n<p>The issue was whether the clause in the contract was a Constitutionally valid one as it did not afford the other party to the contract to state their case before the contract was terminated. \\nSecondly, whether independent schools had constitutional duties and obligations that limited their exercise of contractual rights.</p>\\n\\n<p>The court found that <b>section 8 of the Constitution</b> allowed for the development of the common law to hold independent schools as providing basic education.</p> \\n\\n<p>That the clause was unconstitutional, went against public policy and was unenforceable because there was no fair procedure followed in the case. It was found that once an independent school provided basic education then it was required of that school to ensure that the education of the children attending the school were not affected. The argument that only the state provides basic education and not independent schools was based on incorrect pre-constitutional common law principles that cannot stand in light of the Constitution. The common law was developed under <b>section 8(3)(a)</b> to hold independent schools of providing basic education.</p>\\n\\n<p>The court considered whether it was constitutionally valid for independent private schools to expel children without following fair processes. The court held that clause 9.3 of the school\u2019s parent contract is unconstitutional and therefore invalid because the clause does not give an  opportunity for fair processes to the learners or their parents/guardian or representatives to make representations before a decision is made by the school to terminate the parent contract and remove the child from the school. The court held that <b>section 29 of the Constitution</b> places an obligation on all schools, both private and government schools to not impair or interfere with the right to basic education. In this case, the school was unable to demonstrate appropriate reasons for limiting the rights of the applicants to basic education without providing an opportunity to the applicants to make representations to the school before the decision to remove the children from the school had taken place.

The respondent was found guilty of murder and was sentenced to death. In 1997 he however applied for amnesty under the Promotion of National Unity and Reconciliation Act 34 of 1995 and was granted it in 2001. In 2003 the respondent was a candidate to head the Ekurhuleni metro police. The appellant in September and October 2003 published various articles and editorials questioning the respondent\u2019s candidacy and expressed the view that he was a \u201ccriminal\u201d and \u201cmurdered\u201d. Some of the articles failed to mention that the respondent was granted amnesty by the National Truth and Reconciliation Commission and the respondent sued the appellant and other journalists for defamation in the Witwatersrand Local Division (South Gauteng High Court), arguing that the articles were malicious as he was granted amnesty. The respondent was successful in the High Court with the defamation claim and the appellants then appealed to the Supreme Court of Appeal. The Supreme Court of Appeal only partially upheld the appeal and reduced the amount of damages awarded to the respondent. The appellants then appealed to the constitutional Court against the Supreme Court of Appeal judgment and the respondent cross-appealed the reduction in damages awarded by the Supreme Court of Appeal.\\n\\n<p>The key issue the Constitutional Court had to determine was how amnesty granted to the respondent for crimes committed (during the struggle against apartheid) by the National Truth and Reconciliation Commission affected a claim for defamation. The respondent was granted amnesty in terms of the <b>Promotion of National Unity and Reconciliation Act 34 of 1995</b> for crimes committed in 1986. In 2003 the appellants in various commentary covering the candidacy of the respondent for the position of head of the Erkhuleni Metro police referred to the respondent as a \u201cmurderer\u201d and \u201ccriminal\u201d. Justice Cameron writing for the majority geld that the Promotion of National Unity and Reconciliation Act 34 of 1995 did not make the fact that the respondent committed murder untrue and the Act did not prohibit frank public discussion. Justice Cameron emphasised that the requirement that a comment must be \u201dfair\u201d  protects criticism even if it is extreme so long it is without malice, on a matter of public interest and  on facts that are true. The Constitutional Court therefore upheld the appellant\u2019s main appeal and dismissed the respondent\u2019s cross appeal but the Court did find that the appellant had defamed the respondent by claiming falsely that he was not contrite and awarded the respondent damages on this aspect.</p>\\n\\n<p>As the matter essentially concerned a defamation claim and the defences raised thereto a key issue the Constitutional Court had to decide was, how to find a balance between two constitutional rights, namely the appellant\u2019s right to freedom of expression on the one hand and the respondent\u2019s right to human dignity. Justice Cameron writing for the majority, emphasised that the right to human dignity is not only given separate constitutional recognition in s 10 of the Constitution but is also one of the founding values of the society terms of s 1. Therefore, a failure to uphold the right is not only a violation of section 10 but is also a threat to a founding value underpinning the legitimacy of the State. However importantly Cameron J, pointed out that freedom of expression is just as important as human dignity and one cannot say that human dignity trumps freedom of expression. The law of defamation importantly must be interpreted to give effect to the appropriate balance between the right to freedom of expression on the one hand and a person\u2019s human dignity on the other hand. Cameron J held on this interpretation that the requirement that a comment must be \u201cfair\u201d in defence to a claim for defamation gives effect to the balance between the right to freedom of expression and dignity.</p>\\n\\n<p>Partial dissenting judgments were written by Ngcobo J and Mogoeng J. Justice Ngcobo agreed with the majority judgment that the <b>Promotion of National Unity and Reconciliation Act 34 of 1995</b> did not make the facts of the commission of the murders untrue but Ngcobo J held that the balancing of the right to freedom and the right to dignity  required the facts upon which the appellant relied in their comment to include the fact that the respondent was granted amnesty by the National Truth and Reconciliation Commission. However, on reading the coverage of the respondent\u2019s candidacy collectively Ngcobo J found that this fact was adequately stated. Justice Ngcobo however held that since the appellant failed to make reference to the circumstances under which the appellant was released from detention in Mozambique the statement of the appellant concerning gun-running allegations in Mozambique was based on \u201chalf-truths\u201d and therefore was untrue, justifying the respondent\u2019s cross appeal. Justice Mogoeng in his judgment specifically held that the defamatory statements that the respondent was a \u201ccriminal\u201d and \u201cmurder \u201cmust be determined within the context of the objective of the amnesty process and that the truth told during the amnesty process was not meant to be used in a manner that defeats the purpose of national reconciliation. Justice Mogoeng held that the defamatory statements that the respondent was a \u201cmurderer\u201d and \u201ccriminal\u201d was malicious and was contrary to the pursuit of national reconciliation.</p> ","snippet":"","facts":"","decision":"","dissent":"","citedCases":["Albutt v Centre for the Study of Violence and Reconciliation and Others 2010 (3) SA 293 (CC)","Azanian Peoples Organisation (AZAPO) and Others v President of the Republic of South Africa and Others 1996 (4) SA 671 (CC)","Bhe and Others v Magistrate, Khayelitsha, and Others (Commission for Gender Equality, as amicus curiae); Shibi v Sithole and Others; South African Human Rights Commission and Another v President of the Republic of South Africa and Another 2005 (1) SA 580 (CC)","Br\xfcmmer v Minister for Social Development and Others 2009 (6) SA 323 (CC)","Dawood and Another v Minister of Home Affairs and Others; Shalabi and Another v Minister of Home Affairs and Others; Thomas and Another v Minister of Affairs and Others 2000 (8) BCLR 837 (CC)","Dikoko v Mokhatla 2007 (1) BCLR 1 (CC)","Doctors for Life International v Speaker of the National Assembly and Others 2006 (6) SA 416 (CC)","Du Toit v Minister for Safety and Security and Another 2009 (12) BCLR 1171 (CC)","Government of the Republic of South Africa and Others v Grootboom and Others 2001 (1) SA 46 (CC)","Islamic Unity Convention v Independent Broadcasting Authority and Others  2002 (4) SA 294 (CC)","Khumalo and Others v Holomisa 2002 (5) SA 401 (CC)","Le Roux and Others v Dey [2011] ZACC 4","Minister for Justice and Constitutional Development v Chonco and Others 2010 (4) SA 82 (CC)","National Coalition for Gay and Lesbian Equality and Another v Minister of Justice and Others 1998 (12) BCLR 1517 (CC)","President of the Republic of South Africa and Another v Hugo 1997 (6) BCLR 708 (CC)","S v Mamabolo (E TV and Others, intervening) 2001 (5) BCLR 449 (CC)","Shalabi and Another v Minister of Home Affairs and Others; Thomas and Another v Minister of Home Affairs and Others [2000] ZACC 8; 2000 (3) SA 936 (CC)","South African Broadcasting Corp Ltd v National Director of Public Prosecutions and Others 2007 (1) SA 523 (CC)\\n "]},{"id":"PortElizabethMunicipalityvVariousOccupiers","href":"http://www.saflii.org/za/cases/ZACC/2004/7.html\\r\\r","title":"Port Elizabeth Municipality v Various Occupiers\\r\\n\\r","featured":false,"highlighted":false,"dateOfJudgment":"2004-10-01T00:00:00+00:00","courtName":"Constitutional Court","topics":["sec_25__Property_Rights"],"justicesConcurring":"Sachs J (Chaskalson CJ, Langa DCJ, Madala J, Mokgoro J, Moseneke J, Ngcobo J; O\u2019Regan J, Skweyiya J, Van der Westhuizen J and Yacoob J concurring)","summary":"The Port Elizabeth Municipality required an eviction order against 68 people who erected and occupied 29 shacks on privately owned land within the municipality.

The court held that the provisions of <b>section 25 (4) and (5)</b> must be borne in mind whenever <b>section 25</b> was being construed, this is because they emphasised that under the Constitution, the protection of property as an individual right was not absolute but subject to societal considerations.</p>\\n\\n<p>The Prevention of Illegal Eviction from and Unlawful Occupation of Land Act cannot simply be looked at as a legislative mechanism to re-establish common law property rights and it should not be seen as a means of promoting legal compassion in favour of the poor.

The issue before the court was whether a presiding officer who was not a magistrate should have the power to commit to prison a recalcitrant witness as provided for in section 66(3) of the Insolvency Act. The Court decided that the High Court order was only confirmed to the extent that section 66(3) of the Insolvency Act was unconstitutional in so far as it authorized a presiding officer who was not a magistrate to commit a disobedinet witness to prison. As such, the provisions of section 66(3) were only unconstitutional were they empowered a presiding officer who was not a magistrate to commit an uncooperative witness to imprisonment as these were the powers of judicial officers. The court ruled that only judicial officers may, consistent with the proper separation of government powers, commit recalcitrant witnesses to prison. The court said that the power to commit an uncooperative witness to prison was within the very core of constitutional judicial power and therefore could not be exercised by non-judicial officers. </p>\\n\\n\\n<p>In majority, the court concluded that the power to commit disobedient witnesses at insolvency hearings served an important public objective which was to ensure that insolvents and other persons who are in a position to give important information relating to an insolvency did not avoid providing it.

It ruled further that the order of invalidity made by the High Court was confirmed only to the extent that section 66(3), read with section 39(2) of the Insolvency Act  24 of 1936, was unconstitutional where it authorised a presiding officer who was not a magistrate to issue a warrant committing to prison a witness at a creditors meeting held under section 65 of the Insolvency Act.</p>\\n\\n<p> The court held that section 66(3) was not inconsistent with any fair procedure right protected by <b>section 12(1) of the Constitution</b>. However, the court found that the committal provision of section 66(3), read with section 39(2) of the Insolvency Act, infringed <b>section 12(1)(b) of the 1996 Constitution</b> only to the extent that a person who is not a magistrate is authorised by the subsection to issue a warrant committing to prison an examinee at a creditors meeting held under section 65 of the Insolvency Act. </p>\\n\\n<p>In its dissent, the court disagreed with the majority court decision that section 66(3) of the Insolvency act would be invalid where it empowered a presiding officer who was not a magistrate to issue a warrant of committal to prison.

It held that section 66(3) Insolvency Act did not infringe the rule of law or the doctrine of separation of powers and  that it was not unconstitutional for an officer who was not a magistrate presiding over a creditors meeting to commit a recalcitrant witness to imprisonment.</p>","snippet":"","facts":"","decision":"","dissent":"","citedCases":[""]},{"id":"SvDodo","href":"http://www.saflii.org/za/cases/ZACC/2001/16.html","title":"S v Dodo ","featured":false,"highlighted":false,"dateOfJudgment":"2001-04-05T00:00:00+00:00","courtName":"Constitutional Court","topics":["Separation_of_Powers"],"justicesConcurring":"Ackermann J","summary":"The applicants applied for confirmation of the constitutional invalidity of section 51(1) of the Criminal Law Amendment Act, 105 of 1997 by the Eastern Cape High Court under the provisions of <b>section 172(2) of the Constitution</b>.

The Constitutional Court only had to determine the constitutionality of certain provisions of s 417 of the Companies Act 61 of 1973, concerning the summoning of persons during the winding-up provisions of two companies. The facts relavnt to this matter is that in both matters the applicants were summoned for examination in terms of s 417 of the Companies Act 61 of 1973 in the winding-up process of two companies. In both cases the applicants objected to being compelled to answer questions put to them that might tend to incriminate them and they applied to the Witwatersrand Local Division of the Supreme Court for a temporary interdict against the respondents, prohibiting further interrogation pending the determination of the constitutionality of s 417(2)(b) of the Companies Act. The Witwatersrand Local Division of the Supreme Court also heard the two matters together and referred the constitutional challenge to the Constitutional Court.\\n\\n<p>The Constitutional Court essentially had to determine the constitutionality of certain provisions of s 417 of the Companies Act 61 of 1973, relating to the examination of persons in the winding-up process of companies. The applicants (as they were referred to in the two referral cases) objected to being compelled to answer questions put to them which might tend to incriminate them. The applicants held that any answer given might be used in evidence against them in subsequent criminal proceedings, infringing on their <b>section 25(3)</b> constitutional right to a fair criminal trial (in terms of the then Interim Constitution \u2013 similar provision in <b>section 35(1)(c) of the Constitution</b>). The applicants held that the right against self-incrimination is not limited to detained, arrested or accused persons (as per s 25 of the Interim Constitution) but also extends to \u201cextra-curial proceedings\u201d including proceedings in terms of s 417 of the Companies Act 61 of 1973. The infringement of various other constitutional rights including the right to freedom and security of the person and personal privacy in ss 11 and 13 of the Interim Constitution respectively were  also argued in the alternative.</p>\\n\\n<p>The majority judgment written by Ackerman J, held that in order to rely on s 25(3) of the Constitution there must \u201cbe an infringement or threat\u201d to the right and the s 25(3) rights only accrue an \u201caccused person\u201d in a criminal trial. The threat only arises once a person who tendered evidence in a section 417 enquiry is accused in a criminal trial and that evidence tendered is specifically used.  Therefore s 417(2)(b) of the Companies Act 61 of 1973 was not held to constitute an infringement on any section 25(3) rights and the majority dismissed this challenge. Justice Ackerman then considered the alternative main argument that s 417 of the Companies Act 61 of 1973 infringed ss 11 and 13 of the Interim Constitution. On this analysis Ackerman J held that this analysis required two stages. One first has to determine whether there was   an infringement off ss 11 and 13 of the Constitution. If there was an infringement then one has to analyse whether this infringement may be justified under <b>s 33(1) of the Interim Constitution</b> (the limitation clause \u2013 now <b>section 36 of the Constitution</b>). On this analysis Ackerman J, held that s 417(2)(b) of the Companies Act unduly infringed on s 11(1) of the Interim Constitution and declared it invalid only to the extent that answers given at such an enquiry may be used against such a person in criminal proceedings against the person. </p>\\n\\n<p>It is firstly important to note that this matter was heard in terms of the Interim Constitution. <b>Section 36 of the Constitution</b> (the limitation of rights provision) was found in section 33 of the Interim Constitution. It is important to note that this judgment confirmed that the limitation of rights concerns two stages. The first stage involves a consideration of the scope of the constitutional right and the challenged law. Ackerman J writing for the majority analysed whether section 417(2)(b) of the Companies Act 633 of 1971 firstly limited <b>section 11(1) of the Interim Constitution</b>, relating to the right to freedom and security of the person. Ackerman J emphasised that a broad interpretation should be given at this stage of the entrenched right as the second stage of the limitation test involving <b>section 33(1) of the Interim Constitution</b> prescribes the criteria that has to be met before an entrenched right can be limited. Ackerman held that s 417(2)(b) limited <b>section 11(1) of the Interim Constitution</b> and then turned to the second stage of the limitation test. The second stage involved analysing whether this limitation could be justified as reasonable in a democratic society taking into account the prescribed factors in <b>section 33 (1) of the Interim Constitution</b>. Ackerman J, importantly emphasised in this matter that the onus is on the party relying on the legislation to justify the limitation in terms of <b>section 33(1) of the Interim Constitution</b> and not for the party challenging it. On applying the second stage of the limitation test, Ackerman J held that section 417(2)(b) unduly infringed on <b>section 11(1) of the Interim Constitution</b>.</p>\\n\\n<p>The dissenting judgment was written by Kriegler J. Although Kriegler J agreed with the majority judgments that the rights in terms of <b>section 25(3) of the Interim Constitution</b> does not extend to witnesses at a section 417 enquiry, he disagreed that <b>section 11(1) of the Interim Constitution</b> applied to this case. Kriegler J essentially raised concerns on the timing of the matter and held that access to the Constitutional Court in terms of section 100(2) of the Constitution and Rule 17 of the Constitutional Rules was not justified by the applicants. The applicants only had a \u201chypothetical fears\u201d that the evidence given at such an enquiry may be used in a subsequent criminal proceeding. The matter would only have been ripe in the event that the applicants were challenged at a criminal trial with the evidence they have given and then only could they have resorted to their <b>section 25(3)</b> constitutional rights.</p>","snippet":"","facts":"","decision":"","dissent":"","citedCases":[""]},{"id":"DanielsvScribanteandAnother","href":"\\nhttp://www.saflii.org/za/cases/ZACC/2020/12.html","title":"Daniels v Scribante and Another","featured":false,"highlighted":false,"dateOfJudgment":"2017-05-11T00:00:00+00:00","courtName":"Constitutional Court","topics":["sec_8__Application"],"justicesConcurring":"Mogoeng CJ, Moseneke DCJ, Bosielo J, Cameron J, Froneman J, Jafta J, Khampepe J, Madlanga J, Mhlantla J, Nkabinde J, and Zondo J.

The court held that gay people were a vulnerable minority group in society. Sodomy laws criminalized their most intimate relationships and this devalued and degraded gay men and therefore constituted a violation of their fundamental right to dignity.

In 1997, the second applicant, was taken from her biological parents whilst in the maternity ward at a hospital. In 2015 when the applicant was 17 years old, she was found by her biological parents. Her abductor was criminally charged and prosecuted, and the applicant was a potential, witness in the trial. The trial was scheduled to begin after applicant\u2019s 18th birthday.

The media respondents asserted that the two extensions of section 154(3) are constitutionally impermissible, as they are in conflict with the rights to freedom of expression and the principle of open justice. The issue before the court was that section 154(3) expressly provided anonymity protection for child accused or witnesses in criminal proceedings, however, the protection did not extend to child victims. The court also had to determine whether the protection afforded by section 154(3) should extend into adulthood for child accused, witnesses and victims.</p>\\n\\n<p>The court held that the predominant purpose of section 154(3) of the Criminal Procedure Act was child protection. Protection from the potentially harmful effects of the publication of their names and identities as a result of being implicated in criminal proceedings. Since this protection is only afforded to child accused and witnesses, there was a gap in the law as it pertained to protecting child victims in criminal proceedings. The court held that the exclusion of child victims in section 154(3) limited the right to equality, as it constituted a one-sided differentiation that did not offer equal protection and benefit of the law. The court found that rights of children, their dignity and privacy were inherently linked, as each child had their own \u201cindividual dignity, special needs and interests\u201d. To not have control over how some of the most traumatic and intimate moments of a child\u2019s life are shared with the public attacked the very core of the child\u2019s dignity.</p>\\n\\n<p>The court found that the right to dignity limited the reach of the right to freedom of expression, which is guaranteed by <b>section 16 of the Constitution</b> and included <b>the right of the media to publish information</b>. The right to publish information was not to be used to justify the breach of the right to dignity. The court found that limitations arising from a failure to provide ongoing protection were not justified. The purpose of freedom of expression and open justice were compelling, but when it came to the balancing of these competing rights, the best interests of children, the right to dignity and privacy outweighed the barrier to the principle of open justice. The serious harms caused to child participants, overshadow the minimal harm to open justice. The granting of the default ongoing protection would not present a harsh interference into media freedom. </p>\\n\\n<p>The court held that the best interest of the child principle combined with the rights to dignity and privacy warrant ongoing protection for child participants into adulthood. The majority judgment states that there are different but warranted justifications for ongoing protection afforded to child victims, witnesses and accused. The court acknowledged the open justice principle and the importance of freedom of expression, however held that the default position of offering the child participants ongoing protection did not result in a severe disadvantage on media freedom. Court declared <b>section 154(3)</b> invalid and ordered an interim reading-in which requires that a person who is subject to the protection of the section does not forfeit the protections upon reaching adulthood, and is entitled to consent to the publication of their identity after reaching adulthood, or if consent is refused, a competent court may be approach by the media to request an upliftment of the publication ban.</p>\\n\\n<p>Cameron J, Froneman J and Jafta J agreed with the majority decision on the issue of victim protection but differed on the issue relating to ongoing protection.

The dissenting Justices held further that the conclusion that the rights to dignity, privacy and the best interests of the child were infringed was hard to understand in the context of the ongoing protection. This was because the issue was that <b>section 154(3)</b> failed to protect children when they turn 18 years of age hence the fear that the media were going to publish the first applicant\u2019s identity when she turned 18.

In a society damaged by violent crime, the importance of protecting this right could not be exaggerated.</p>\\n\\n<p>The court held that the regulatory scheme was carefully designed for the purpose of screening entrants to the private security industry rather than constituting a blanket ban on the registration of refugees as private security service providers. <b>Section 12 of the Constitution</b> provides everyone the right to freedom and security of the person, which included the right to be free from all forms of violence from either public or private sources. That is not to say that foreign nationals, including refugees, are inherently less trustworthy than South Africans. In a country where xenophobia has caused increased suffering, it is important to stress this and that it was not that the Authority did not trust refugees. The Security Act was designed to limit eligibility for registration to people whose trustworthiness could be objectively verified. The preamble to the Act acknowledges that the right to security of the person is fundamental to the well-being and to the social and economic development of every person.</p>\\n\\n<p>In their dissenting judgement, Mokgoro J and O\'Regan J held that section 23(1)(a) of the Private Security Industry Regulation Act discriminated unfairly on the basis of refugee status. The court was not convinced that the purpose identified by the Minister to ensure that security service employees were trustworthy was really provided by the section. The dissenting judgment held that the order it would have proposed was to require that refugees who could meet the other requirements of the Act should not be barred from registration as security service providers. Those refugees who cannot meet those requirements should seek to establish that \u201cgood cause\u201d exists for them to be registered as contemplated by section 23(6).</p>\\n","snippet":"","facts":"","decision":"","dissent":"","citedCases":[""]},{"id":"NMandOthersvSmithandOthersZACCSACCBCLRCC","href":"\\nhttp://www.saflii.org/za/cases/ZACC/2007/6.html","title":"\\nNM and Others v Smith and Others [2007] ZACC 6; 2007 (5) SA 250 (CC); 2007 (7) BCLR 751 (CC)","featured":false,"highlighted":false,"dateOfJudgment":"2007-04-04T00:00:00+00:00","courtName":"Constitutional Court","topics":["sec_14__Privacy"],"justicesConcurring":"\\nMadala J, Moseneke DCJ, Mokgoro J, Skweyiya J, Van der Westhuizen J, Yacoob J, Sachs J, Langa J and O\u2019Regan J.","summary":"The applicants who were HIV positive were involved in clinical trials.

The challenged laws were passed by Parliament, and on 27 January 2009 they were assented to and signed by the President. On 17 April 2009, the applicant challenged the constitutional validity of the impugned laws based on the absence of a rational basis for the enactment of the laws in question. The applicant also alleged that the process of enactment failed to comply with various constitutional obligations relating to accountability and upholding international obligations and allowing the NPA to properly exercise its functions. \\n\\n<p>The applicant made an application to determine the constitutional validity of the National Prosecuting Authority Amendment Act (NPAA Act) and the South African Police Service Amendment Act (SAPSA Act). The issue before the court was whether the national legislation that created the Directorate for Priority Crime Investigation, known as the Hawks (DPCI), and disbanded the Directorate of Special Operations, known as the Scorpions (DSO), is constitutionally valid. The court it held that the Constitution imposed an obligation on the state to establish and maintain an independent body to combat corruption and organised crime. While the Constitution did not expressly command that a corruption-fighting unit should be established, its scheme taken as a whole imposed duty on the state to set up an effective and independent mechanism to prevent and root out corruption.</p>\\n\\n<p>The provisions of <b>section 37(4)(b)(i) of the Constitution</b>, provided that legislation that derogated from the Bill of Rights had to be consistent with the state\u2019s obligations under international law applicable to states of emergency, possibly transforms the rights and obligations embodied in international agreements into constitutional rights and obligations, but only in the limited context of states of emergency.</p>\\n\\n<p>The court found that the DPCI did not meet the constitutional requirement of appropriate independence. The reason behind the court\u2019s conclusion was that the DPCI was insufficiently protected from political influence in its structure and functioning. This was because the DPCI\u2019s activities had to be coordinated by Cabinet. The Court held that the legislation in question was constitutionally invalid to the extent that it failed to secure an adequate degree of independence for the DPCI.</p>\\n\\n<p>The court held that the Constitution imposed an obligation on the state to establish and maintain an independent body to combat corruption and organised crime. <b>Section 37(4)(b)(i)</b> entailed that legislation that deviates from the Bill of Rights had to be consistent with the state\u2019s obligations under international law applicable to states of emergency. It found that the Constitution\'s system, taken as a whole, and the international law agreements which are binding on the state imposed a pressing duty on the state to set up an effective and independent mechanism to prevent and root out corruption. The Court upheld the appeal and declared that the offending legislative provisions establishing the DPCI constitutionally invalid to the extent that they did not secure adequate independence, and suspended the declaration of constitutional invalidity for a period of eighteen months to give Parliament the opportunity to remedy the defect.</p>\\n\\n<p><b>The court held that <b>section 34 of the Constitution</b> entrenches the right to have disputes resolved \u201din a fair public hearing before a court\u201d.

They had approached a company known as SA Multiloan in Stellenbosch for small loans. Later when they fell into arrears, the creditor provider demanded that they sign further documents which resulted in default judgments and emoluments attachment orders obtained by the credit providers. This allowed for the deduction of the judgment debt from their salaries or wages.\\n\\n<p>As a result of this, all the applicants approached the Law Clinic to institute proceedings in the High Court to have section 65(J) declared unconstitutional. Their argument was that section 65(J) allowed for emoluments attachment orders to be obtained without judicial oversight. The High Court agreed with them and declared the section unconstitutional and therefore invalid. Application was then filed to the Constitutional Court to confirm invalidity of section 65(J).</p>\\n\\n\\n<p>The majority judgment, written by Cameron J, disagreed with Jafta J\u2019s conclusion that it was possible to interpret section 65J as providing for judicial oversight. Section 65J(2) licenses the issuing of an emoluments attachment order where the debtor consents in writing; or if \u201cthe court has so authorised\u201d. The conjunction \u201cor\u201d seems to make plain that an emoluments attachment order may be obtained through the debtor\u2019s written consent even when the court has not authorised it. Additionally, section 65J(1) posits that a judgment creditor, not a court, causes an emoluments attachment order to be issued from a court. And once issued, section 65J(5) provides that the order may be executed \u201cas if it were a court judgment\u201d. This wording allows for execution without judicial oversight. The majority judgment therefore concluded that the plain language of the provision shows it permitted judicially unsanctioned enforcement of judgment debts. Therefore, the section was unconstitutional.</p>\\n\\n<p>Zondo J concurred with the majority judgment but wrote separately. He took the view that in order for section 65J(1)(a) to be read to mean that it is the court that issues emoluments attachment orders, one would have to read the phrase <b>\u201cissued from the court\u201d</b> to mean <b>\u201cissued by the court\u201d</b>. Zondo J held that there is no room for this interpretation. </p>\\n\\n<p>The remedy adopted by Zondo J was supported by the majority. It was one of a combination of reading-in and severance and not the remedy adopted by the High Court. Accordingly, Zondo J did not confirm the order of constitutional invalidity made by the High Court, but rather ordered the reading-in, and severance of, certain words in section 65J(2)(a) and (b) in order to remedy the constitutional defect.</p>\\n\\n<p>The majority held that a debtor\u2019s <b>section 34 right of access to court</b> is breached when an execution process against any form of property occurs without judicial oversight of a court.</p>\\n\\n<p>Jafta J held that the High Court erred in proceeding from the premise that s65J(2) did not provide for judicial oversight without interpreting that section. He held that the Court was bound to determine for itself whether indeed the section failed to provide for judicial oversight.</p>\\n\\n<p>Jafta J held further that it should be determined whether the words \u201cfrom the court\u201d are capable of a meaning that accords with the assumed constitutional guarantee that, whenever execution is sought against one\u2019s property \u2013 regardless of whether movable or immovable \u2013 the execution must be subject to judicial oversight.</p>\\n\\n<p>Jafta J held that section 65J indeed provides for judicial supervision. Therefore, assuming that the Constitution requires judicial supervision when emoluments attachment orders are issued, the section meets the requirement. Jafta J added that in these circumstances he cannot confirm the order of invalidity made by the High Court.</p>\\n","snippet":"","facts":"","decision":"","dissent":"","citedCases":[""]},{"id":"FedsureLifeAssuranceLtdandOthersvGreaterJohannesburgTransitionalMetropolitanCouncilandOthers","href":"\\nhttp://www.saflii.org/za/cases/ZACC/1998/17.html ","title":"Fedsure Life Assurance Ltd and Others v Greater Johannesburg Transitional Metropolitan Council and Others","featured":false,"highlighted":false,"dateOfJudgment":"1998-10-14T00:00:00+00:00","courtName":"Constitutional Court","topics":["sec_33__Just_Administrative_Action"],"justicesConcurring":"\\nChaskalson P, Goldstone J and O\u2019Regan J (Ackermann J and Madala J)\\n\\nKriegler J (Langa DP, Mokgoro, Sachs J and Yacoob J)\\n\\n*The Court was unanimous in approach and interpretation of  \u2018administrative action\u2019.","summary":"[Note: This case was decided under the <b>Interim Constitution</b>, but the decision remains relevant and applicable.]\\n\\n<p>[The Eastern Metropolitan Substructure, Western Metropolitan Substructure, Southern Metropolitan Substructure and the Northern Metropolitan Substructure were all transitional substructures of the Greater Johannesburg Transitional Metropolitan Council as at June 1996.]</p>\\n\\n<p>The metropolitan structures passed resolutions to substantially increase general rates on property and property rights within the Eastern and Northern Metropolitan Substructure areas, thereby generating surpluses in income from those areas to offset deficits in the budgets of the Western and Southern  Metropolitan Substructures and Greater Johannesburg  Transitional Metropolitan Council through subsidisation. </p>\\n\\n<p>The result was that ratepayers in some areas were required to pay increased property rates and others enjoyed a decrease in their rates.

When it was sent to the President for his assent, he declined to grant it. Instead, because he had reservations about its constitutionality, he referred it back to the National Assembly for reconsideration. No amendments were made when it was returned to the President. The President then referred it to the Constitutional Court for a decision on its constitutionality.\\n\\n<p>Of importance was whether the Bill dealt with \u201dliquor licences\u201d, which fell within the <b>Schedule 5 exclusive functional area of provincial legislatures</b>, or whether it dealt with issues falling under <b>Schedule 4</b>.</p>\\n\\n\\n<p>The Court held that in a case of overlap between the concurrent powers and exclusive powers of provinces it may be necessary to establish the substance of the legislation. Cameron AJ concluded that the substance of the Liquor Bill is directed at three objectives:</p>\\n<p>(a) the prohibition on cross-holdings between the three tiers involved in the liquor trade, namely, producers, distributors and retailers;</p>\\n<p>(b) the establishment of uniform conditions, in a single system, for the national registration of liquor manufacturers and distributors; and, in a further attempt at establishing national uniformity within the liquor trade;</p>\\n<p>(c) the prescription of detailed mechanisms to provincial legislatures for the establishment of retail licensing mechanisms.</p>\\n\\n<p>The Court held that the Bill\u2019s prohibition of cross-holdings falls within the national legislature\u2019s competence to regulate trade. The national system of registration for producers and wholesalers may well also fall within the national legislature\u2019s competence to regulate trade, since the provinces\u2019 exclusive power in relation \\"liquor licences\\" was not in the first instance intended to encompass manufacturing and distribution of liquor since these activities are inter-provincial and international. The Court held that in any event national government had succeeded in showing that if the exclusive provincial competence regarding \\"liquor licences\\" extends to production and distribution, its interest in maintaining economic unity authorises it to intervene in these areas under <b>section 44(2)</b>. However the Court concluded that the Minister failed to show that the national interest required uniform national legislation prescribing detailed mechanisms to provincial legislatures for the establishment of retail licensing mechanisms.</p>\\n\\n<p>The court held that though South Africa is <b>\u201done, soverign, democratic state\u201d</b>, governmental power is not located in national entities alone. For the court, <b>section 40 of the Constitution</b> introduced a new philosophy of cooperative government. In terms of this philosophy, all spheres of government are required to observe and adhere to the principles of cooperative government set out in <b>Chapter 3 of the Constitution</b>.

Although section 6 provided for the establishment of deeds registries for the registration of deeds of grant and thus created certain land tenure rights, it had to be read within the framework of the whole of the Proclamation, which was mainly aimed at the administration and control of black people.

The Western Cape Provincial Government and the Minister of Trade and Industry responded and appeared before the Court. The court had to determine whether the Bill was unconstitutional. The Minister of Trade and Industry argued that the Bill was not a liquor licensing measure because the matters it regulated fell within the national legislature\u2019s competence and its provisions that dealt with liquor licensing were related to its goal of national competencies. The Minister argued further that even if the Bill infringed on the provinces\u2019 exclusive powers it was justified in terms of <b>section 44(2) of the Constitution</b>. The provisions of <b>section 44(2)</b> allowed the national government to intervene into the area of exclusive provincial legislative competence where this was necessary for certain purposes, which included the maintenance of economic unity. The court held that the Liquor Bill was unconstitutional in that the national government had not succeeded in justifying the Bill\u2019s intervention in the field of retail liquor sales, nor in the case of micro-manufacturers of liquor, whose operations are essentially provincial.</p> \\n\\n\\n<p>In a unanimous decision, the court held that the Liquor Bill was unconstitutional in that the national government had not succeeded in justifying the Bill\u2019s intervention in the field of retail liquor sales, nor in the case of micro-manufacturers of liquor, whose operations are essentially provincial.

The second applicant, a natural person described herself as a representative of Khoi and San communities and a princess of the Korona Royal Household of the Khoi and the San First Nation. It appears that the objectives of the applicants to an extent were similiar and they were essentially averse to joining or forming a political party and believed that the current electoral system infinged on their constitutional rights.The applicants  applied to the Western Cape High Court on an urgent basis to declare <b>the Electoral Act 73 of 1998</b> unconstitutional to the extent that an individual could not contest tha national and provincial elections. The matter was heard on an urgent basis as the national elections were to be held in a few weeks. \\n\\n<p>The Western Cape High Court dismissed the matter on 17 April 2019 and the aApplicants then urgently applied for direct leave to appeal the Western Cape High Court judgment to the Constitutional Court on 19 April 2019. In light of the pending elections, the  Constitutional Court only heard arguments on the question of the urgency of the matter on 2 May 2019.  The Constitutional Court held that the Applicants did not make out a case for urgency and postponed the matter to be argued on 15 August 2019.</p>\\n\\n<p>The New Nation Movement judgment declared the Electoral Act of 1998 unconstitutional, to the extent that individuals can only be elected to the National Assembly and Provincial Legislature through membership of their political parties. It is, however, important to note that the Constitutional Court did not consider what electoral system would be more appropriate, as this falls within the mandate of Parliament, and hence the Order was suspended for two years in order for Parliament to remedy the defect.</p>  \\n\\n<p>The constitutional challenge in the judgment was essentially distilled to two critical aspects. Firstly, the meaning of <b>section 19(3)(b) of the Constitution</b>, which states that <b>\u201cEvery adult citizen has the right (b) to stand for public office and if, elected, to hold office\u201d</b> had to be determined. Secondly, the Court had to determine whether <b>section 57A of the Electoral Act</b>, read with <b>schedule 1A of the Act</b> (which, in effect, required a citizen to be a member of a political party to contest national and provincial elections) unjustifiably limited an individual\u2019s right to freedom of association, provided for in <b>section 18 of the Constitution</b>. The question was approached holistically by Madlanga J who held that that <b>section 19(3)(b) of the Constitution</b> must be read not only in conjunction with the right to freedom of association but also with other political rights in s 19 of the Constitution.  Madlanga J held that the choice to form a political party in terms of <b>section 19(1)</b> equally includes the right not to join a political party. If <b>section 19(3)(b)</b> is read that only by joining a political party an individual can exercise the right to stand for public office, then it is in conflict with <b>section 19(1)</b>, which equally protects the choice not to join a political party.</p> \\n\\n<p>On the second aspect concerning the right to freedom of association, Madlanga J held that on consideration of foreign and international law, the right equally includes the right not to be forced to join an association. The question then turned to whether the limitation of the right to freedom of association by the Electoral Act could be justified as a reasonable limitation in terms of <b>section 36 of the Constitution</b>. The majority however found that the respondents were unable to justify on evidence  the limitation and  therefore the Electoral Act was held to be unconstitutional, to the extent that it excluded independent candidates to contest national and provincial elections.</p>\\n\\n<p>In the Constitution, <b>section 1</b> refers to the founding values of the Constitution. These values emphasise that the Republic of South Africa is \u201cone, sovereign, democratic state\u201d which is founded on various core value such as human dignity, non-racialism, supremacy of the Constitution and a multi-party system of democratic governance. It is  important to note that these  founding values form the premise of our constitutional order and in terms of the Constitution a high threshold is required to amend these provisions.</p>\\n\\n<p>In this judgment <b>section 1 (d) of the Constitution</b> was specifically considered as the Western Cape High Court held that the founding values of <b>section 1(d)</b> do not support the applicant\u2019s case. <b>Section 1(d) of the Constitution</b> provides that the founding values of the Republic include: \u201dUniversal adult suffrage, a national common voters roll, regular elections and a multi-party system of democratic government, to ensure accountability, responsiveness and openness\u201d. The applicants argued that <b>section 1(d) of the Constitution</b> cannot be read as requiring an exclusively party based proportional representation system.\\n\\n<p>The majority of the Constitutional Court on considering this aspect, held that section 1(d) of the Constitution says nothing about the exclusivity of multi-party representation. A multi-party democracy allows different political groups to organise and participate in an election but this does not mean only political groups can do so. In this regard the majority relied on the Constitutional Court judgment of United Democratic Movement v President of the Republic of South Africa.</p>\\n\\n<p>Due to the importance of political rights with the South African context, <b>section 19(3)(b)</b> needed to be interpreted generously and not restrictively.\\n\\n<p><b>Section 19 (1)</p> enables a person not to form or join a political party and this should be protected as a political choice. Once a person is made to join a political party to exercise their <b>section 19(3)(b)</b> right, that means that the choice afforded to them by s 19(1) is no longer there.  The Electoral Act limits <b>section 19(3)(b)</b> because it makes it impossible for candidates to stand for political office without first being members of a political party. This limitation was not justified and it also was not reasonable.  The Electoral Act was unconstitutional to the extent that it limited <b>sections 19(1) and 19(3)(b)</b>. \\n\\n<p>The dissenting judgment was written by Froneman J, who agreed that leave to appeal should have been grantedn but disagreed with the reasoning and outcome on the merits of the appeal. Essentially Froneman J disagreed with the majority\u2019s interpretation of  \u201dto stand for public office and, if elected, to hold office\u201din <b>section 19(3)(b) of the Constitution</b> and held that it was not shown that the Constitution prescribes something other than political parties in its fundamental multi-party system of democratic governance.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n","snippet":"","facts":"","decision":"","dissent":"","citedCases":[""]},{"id":"KhosaandOthersvMinisterofSocialDevelopmentandOthersMahlauleandAnothervMinisterofSocialDevelopment","href":"\\nhttp://www.saflii.org/za/cases/ZACC/2004/11.html","title":"\\nKhosa and Others v Minister of Social Development and Others, Mahlaule and Another v Minister of Social Development","featured":false,"highlighted":false,"dateOfJudgment":"2004-03-04T00:00:00+00:00","courtName":"Constitutional Court","topics":["sec_20__Citizenship"],"justicesConcurring":"Mokgoro J (Chaskalson CJ, Langa DCJ, Goldstone J, Moseneke J, O\u2019Regan J and Yacoob J) (majority) \\nNgcobo J (Madala J) (minority)","summary":"The applicants challenged certain provisions of the Social Assistance Act 59 of 1992 which disqualified persons who are not South African citizens from receiving certain welfare grants.

Inama Trust applied and was granted authorisation to construct a filling station by the  Mpumalanga environmental authorities. The applicant in the proceedings, Fuel Retailers Association of Southern Africa, an organisation which represents the interests of fuel retailers, objected the construction of the filing station stating that it will have an adverse impact on the environment. The applicant further objected the granting of the application by Inama Trust arguing that the authorities did not consider the proposed developments social, environmental and economic impacts in light of <b>section 24 of the Constitution</b>. \\n\\n<p>The applicant requested the authorisation of the construction of the filling station be set aside by the court and consideration of the social, economic and eviromental impacts of the proposed project be considered in light of <b>section 24 of the Constitution</b>.</p> \\n\\n<p>The court considered whether the enviromental considerations were balanced with socio-economic considerations through the ideal of sustainable development. The court held that the <b>National Enviromental Management Act of 1998</b> was enacted to give effect to <b>section 24 of the Constitution</b>, and that the act embraces the concept of sustainable development and requires people and their needs to be placed at the forefront of environmental management. The test to be applied in the cirsumstances is to assess, evaluate and consider whether the social, economic and environmental impact of the proposed development of the filling station was appropriately applied when the decision was taken to grant the application. Additionally, the test also requires that decisions must take into account the interests, needs and values of all interested and affected persons.</p>\\n\\n<p>The court held that the socio-economic development and the protection of the environment are interlinked. Therefore in this case the establishment of filling stations in close proximity to one another may increase the pre-existing risk of adverse impact on the environment. The risk of contamination of underground water, soil, visual intrusion and light. An additional filling station may significantly increase this risk and increase environmental stress. The filling station may also affect the sustainability of existing filling stations with consequences for the job security of the employees of those filling stations. The court held that the enviromental authorities did not consider  the impact of the increasing number of filling stations and of proposed filling station on existing ones. The court set aside the decision by the enviromental authorities stating that the authorities misconstrued the nature of their obligations and as a consequence failed to comply with a compulsory and material condition prescribed by the law for granting authorisation to establish a filling station.</p>\\n\\n<p>The court held that <b>section 24 of the Constitution</b> recognises the interrelationship between the protection of the environment and socio-economic development. It contemplates the integration of environmental protection and socio-economic development and envisages that the two will be balanced through the ideal of sustainable development.  The obligation of the environmental authorities to consider socio-economic factors includes the obligation to consider the impact of the increasing number of filling stations and of proposed filling station on existing ones. This obligation is wider than the requirement to assess need and desirability.  Court held that the authorities misconstrued the nature of their obligations and as a consequence failed to comply with a compulsory and material condition prescribed by the law for granting authorisation to establish a filling station. The court set aside the decision of the environmental authorities granting authorisation to construct the proposed filling station and ordered the environmental authorities to reconsider the application by Inama Trust in the light of the judgment.</p>\\n\\n<p>Sachs J dissenting judgement held that evidence does not indicate that opening a new filling station would pose or suggest any undue threat to the environment. That the question of sustainable development does not arise because this case does not require a decision on whether on balance the gains made in socio-economic development by opening up a new enterprise could appropriately permit a certain degree of negative impact on the environment. This matter was focused on the risk of overtrading and profits of existing petrol stations. This case is a question of the economic factor that should have been taken into account when the question of sustainable development was being considered. However, the question of possible overtrading is not one which decision-makers in this matter were called upon to consider. Therefore, the dissenting judgement held that the decision to set aside the determination of the decision-makers was not supported.</p> \\n","snippet":"","facts":"","decision":"","dissent":"","citedCases":[""]},{"id":"MECDepartmentofAgricultureConservationandEnvironmentandAnothervHTFDevelopersPtyLimited","href":"\\nhttp://www.saflii.org/za/cases/ZACC/2007/25.html ","title":"MEC: Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Environment and Another v HTF Developers (Pty) Limited\\n","featured":false,"highlighted":false,"dateOfJudgment":"2007-12-06T00:00:00+00:00","courtName":"Constitutional Court","topics":["sec_24__Environment"],"justicesConcurring":"\\nSkweyiya J [ Moseneke DCJ, Sachs J and Van der Westhuizen J ]\\nNgcobo J [ seperate concurring] ","summary":"The respondent HTF developers owns property which, with the approval of the relevant housing authority, planned to sub-divide into residential stands for sale to individual buyers.

The cultivation or use of virgin ground was considered to have a substantial detrimental effect on the environment in terms of <b>section 21(1) of the  Environmental Conservation Act of 1989 (ECA)</b> and therefore prohibited in terms of <b>section 22 of the ECA</b> unless written authorisation was granted. The respondent argued that  the land in question did not fall within the definition of \u201cvirgin land\u201d and therefore the construction activities were not subject to the authorisation in terms of the act. Accordingly, the respondent insisted that the first applicant did not have the legal basis for directing that development of the property must stop.\\n\\n<p>The case is concerned primarily with the interaction of two sections in the Environment Conservation Act of 1989 ( ECA), which allowed the applicant, the provincial Department for Agriculture, Conservation & Environment in Gauteng to prevent the development of a housing estate as a result of the applicants understanding that the development threatened the existence of certain Red Data species and naturally existing corridors that are formed by naturally formed geological ridges in Gauteng. Section 31A of the ECA empowers a named authority to direct any person who performs or fails to perform an activity that is causing or may cause damage to the environment, to stop the harmful activity or take remedial steps within a specified period.

The court held that Section 31A must be interpreted in a manner that is consistent with the overall framework of the ECA. That Section 31A cannot be subject to the rigid procedural requirements of <b>Section 32</b> because this would hamper the ability of officials to respond appropriately to harmful situations.</p>\\n \\n<b>The court held that in interpreting the relevant sections of the ECA, the test is to use the constitutional right to environmental considerations of <b>section 24</b> and the principles articulated by the National Environmental Management Act of 1998 (NEMA), in particular the need to achieve socially, environmentally and economically sustainable development.</b>\\n\\n<p>The court held that the observance of the 30-day notice and comment procedure is appropriate for directions generally applicable to members of the public, and not to directions applicable to a specific person or entity. Directions issued in term of section 31A are, however, subject to procedural fairness requirements in the form of section 36 of the ECA and administrative review under the Promotion of Administrative Justice Act of 2000. Further, the urgency of the situation may dictate the extent of the procedural fairness imposed on the administrator. This interpretation allows for sufficient procedural flexibility, which is necessary for organs of state to react to potential or actual environmental damage in a range of different time frames.

Many had applied for subsidized low-cost housing through the municipality and had been on the waiting list for a period of up to seven years. While waiting to be allocated housing, they decided to move and illegally live on someones private land. Respondents were then evicted from these informal homes.Respondents applied to the High Court seeking an order requiring the government to provide them with adequate basic shelter or housing until they obtained permanent accommodation and certain relief. Respondents stated that <b>sections 26 and 28 of the Constitution of South Africa</b> guaranteed the right of everyone to access to adequate housing and the right of children to be afforded special protection, and, in particular, shelter. The appellants were ordered to provide the respondents with tents, portable latrines and a regular supply of water by way of minimal shelter. This decision formed the basis for the appeal to the Constitutional Court.\\n\\n<p>The court considered whether the measures taken by the state to realise the rights afforded by s26 of the consititution were reasonable. Whether the City of Cape Town\u2019s housing programmes met the obligations imposed on them by <b>section 26</b>.  The court found the right to access to adequate housing could not be seen in isolation; it had to be interpreted in the light of its close relationship with the other socio-economic rights.</p>\\n\\n<p>The court held that the state was obliged to take positive action to meet the needs of those living in extreme conditions of poverty, homelessness or intolerable housing. In this case the determination of a minimum obligation in the context of the right to have access to adequate housing presented difficult questions, because the needs of the respondents were so diverse.  The court held that the state therefore had to create the conditions for access to adequate housing for people at all economic levels of society. The extent of the state\'s obligation was defined by three key elements, which had to be considered separately: the obligation to take reasonable legislative and other measures, to achieve the progressive realisation of s26, and within available resources. For a person to have access to adequate housing, the court held, there had to be the provision of land, services (such as the provision of water, the removal of sewage and the financing of all these) and a dwelling.</p>\\n\\n<p>The court further held that <b>section 26</b> placed a obligation on the state and all other entities and persons to desist from preventing or impairing the right of access to adequate housing. The manner in which the eviction in this case had been carried out had resulted in a breach of this obligation.</p>\\n\\n<p>A reasonable housing program, capable of facilitating the realisation of the right, had clearly to allocate responsibilities and tasks to the different spheres of government and ensure that the appropriate financial and human resources were available to implement it. The formation of a program, however, was only the first stage in meeting the state\'s obligations. The program also had to be reasonably implemented, as failure to do so would not constitute compliance with the state\'s obligations. The court therefore issued a declaratory order which required the state to devise and implement a programme that included measures to provide relief.</p>\\n\\n<p>The Court first examined what the precise obligations of the government are under <b>section 26 of the Constitution</b>. In doing so, the Court stated that <b>section 26</b> must be interpreted in light of the remainder of the Constitution and the historical and social circumstances in which it is set. Section 26 requires that the state take reasonable legislative and other measures within the context of available resources to ensure access to adequate housing. The Court determined that the nationwide housing programme falls short of constitutional obligations insofar as it fails to provide relief for those in desperate need of housing.</p>\\n\\n<p>Further, the court confirmed that  the Constitution does not draw a distinction between housing, on one hand, and shelter on another. And so it concluded that that neither <b>section 26 nor section 28 of the Constitution</b> can be read to entitle respondents to claim shelter immediately upon demand.

Eighty-six poor individuals were unlawfully occupying private unused industrial facilities as living quarters.  The owner of the property (Blue Moonlight) sued to evict the occupiers in order to develop the property, which would almost certainly render them homeless.  The occupiers argued that the city had an obligation to provide them with temporary housing under the Constitution and the <b>Prevention of Illegal Eviction and Unlawful Occupation of Land Act, 19 of 1998 (PIE Act)</b> before they could be evicted. \\n\\n<p>The court considered whether the 86 occupiers must be evicted to allow the owner to fully exercise its rights regarding its property and, if so, whether their eviction must be linked to an order that the City provide them with accommodation. The applicant\u2019s position is that it is neither obliged nor able to provide accommodation in these circumstances. The owner wishes to exercise its right to develop its property and wants no part in the dispute about the City\u2018s responsibilities or the plight of the occupiers. The court held that a court cannot grant an eviction order pursuant to the PIE Act unless it is just and equitable to do so.  In deciding whether an eviction is just and equitable, the court considered that many of the occupiers had lived on the property for a very long time, the occupation had once been lawful, Blue Moonlight was aware of the occupiers\u2019 presence when it purchased the property, and the eviction of the occupiers would render them homeless while there was no competing risk of homelessness on the part of Blue Moonlight.  The Court found that eviction would not be just or equitable until the city could provide the occupiers with alternate housing.  The court stated that in circumstances where an eviction of occupiers from private property would render the occupiers homeless, the rights of the property owners may have to temporarily yield to the occupiers\u2019 right to housing.</p>\\n\\n<p>The Court therefore ordered the city to provide the occupiers with adequate alternate housing. In so doing, the Court rejected the city\u2019s contention that the city did not have adequate financial resources with which to provide alternate housing.  Finally, the Court insisted that there be a link between the date of eviction and the date by which the city would have to provide such housing to ensure that the occupiers were not rendered homeless by the eviction.</p>\\n\\n<p>The court held that an owner\'s constitutional right not to be deprived of property, must be interpreted in a social and historical context and be balanced against the right of access to adequate housing and not to be evicted arbitrarily from one\'s home. In this case even though housing unlawful occupiers indefinitely suspends an owner\'s right to use and enjoy property, evictions can only be carried out in terms of the PIE act, and are only permissible where just and equitable.</p>\\n\\n<p>Whether it was just and equitable to order eviction under PIE act depended on whether the City had made reasonable efforts to provide alternative accommodation to the occupiers. The Court held that the City unreasonably and thus unconstitutionally breached the occupiers\u2019 right of access to adequate housing under s 26 of the Constitution by not providing them with temporary accommodation, in circumstances in which their imminent eviction would render them homeless.</p> \\n\\n<p>The City\u2019s claim that it lacked the resources to do so was rejected. The court therefore held that the occupiers had to vacate the properties by a given date, but stipulated that the City was to provide the evictees with \\"temporary accommodation in a location as near as feasibly possible to the area\\" in which the building was situated.</p>\\n\\n<p>The court emphasised that this case concerns temporary as defined in Chapter 12 and not permanent housing. The obligation, while derived from the right to progressive realisation of adequate housing in terms of <b>section 26(2) of the Constitution</b>, is distinct from the obligation to address permanent housing needs.</p>\\n\\n","snippet":"","facts":"","decision":"","dissent":"","citedCases":[""]},{"id":"MinisterofHealthandOthersvTreatmentActionCampaignandOthersNo","href":"http://www.saflii.org/za/cases/ZACC/2002/15.html","title":"Minister of Health and Others v Treatment Action Campaign and Others (No 2)","featured":true,"highlighted":false,"dateOfJudgment":"2002-07-05T00:00:00+00:00","courtName":"Constitutional Court","topics":["sec_27__Healthcare,_Food,_Water_and_Security"],"justicesConcurring":"Chief Justice Chaskalson A ; Deputy Chief Justice Langa PN; Justice Ackermann L; Justice Goldstone RJ; Acting Justice Du Plessis B; Justice Kriegler JC;  Justice Madala T; Justice Ngcobo S; Justice O\u2019 Reagen K; Justice Sachs AL  and Acting Justice Skewyiya T","summary":"The respondents in the Constitutional Court judgment concerned various civil society organisations and associations involved in the treatment of people with HIV/AIDS. The respondents launched a constitutional challenge in the North Gauteng High Court challenging the applicant\u2019s programme for the prevention of mother-to-child transmission of HIV and provision of the anti-retroviral drug, Nevaripine at only certain limited research public healthcare facilities. The North Gauteng High Court made a structural interdict that obliged the State to extend the provision of Nevirapine to pregnant women with HIV beyond the limited public research facilities and to provide a comprehensive plan to prevent or reduce the prevention of HIV transmission from mother to child. The judgment was appealed by the applicants and the Constitutional Court specifically considered the applicants\u2019 policy in light of its constitutional obligations in terms of <b>sections 27(1)(a) and (2) of the Constitution</b>.The Constitutional Court held that the applicants failed to fulfil their constitutional duty in this regard.\\n\\n<p>This Constitutional Court judgment is critical in understanding the obligations resting on the State in terms of <b>section 27(2) of the Constitution</b> in fulfilling access to a socio-economic right, in this regard specifically the constitutional right to access healthcare services. <b>Sections 27(1)(a)) of the Constitution</b> provides that everyone has the right to have access to health care services, that includes reproductive healthcare. The right however is not an absolute right against the State. The State must show it took \u201creasonable legislative and other measures, within its available resources\u201d to make the right available.</p>\\n\\n<p>The Constitutional Court essentially focused on two issues. Firstly,  the reasonability of  the applicant\u2019s policy that restricted  the provision of the anti-retroviral drug, Nevirapine to  pregnant women  at only certain public  healthcare training and research facilities. Secondly, the reasonability of the State\u2019s failure  develop a comprehensive programme to combat mother-to-child transmission of HIV in light of the State\u2019s obligations in terms of <b>sections 27(1)(a) and (2) of the Constitution</b>.</p> \\n\\n<p>A key aspect that stood out in  analysing the reasonability of the applicants\u2019 policy restricting the provision of Nevaripine, was the applicants\u2019 failure  to take into account pregnant HIV mothers and their new-born children who do not have access to these public research sites. No provision was made for these extremely vulernable group of women.</p>\\n\\n<p>The North Gauteng High Court\u2019s structural interdict was set aside by the Constitutional Court  and the Constitutional Court made various detailed orders including  removing the  present restrictions on the administration of Nevirapine without delay. The Constitutional Court also confirmed that  the applicants have a constitutional duty  to devise a comprehensive plan to ensure pregnant women and their new-born babies have access to healthcare services to combat mother-to child transmission of HIV.</p>\\n\\n<p>On considering the obligations of <b>sections 27(1)(a) and (2) of the Constitution</b> on the applicants, the Constitutional Court recognised that the Executive has the prerogative to make policy. However, the Court has a duty to determine whether these measures adopted are reasonable. In this regard the Constitutional Court relied strongly on the Constitutional Court judgment of Government of the Republic of South Africa and Others v Grootboom and Other that held :  <b>\u201cto be reasonable, measures cannot leave out of account the degree and extent of the denial of the right they endeavour to realise. Those whose needs are the most urgent and whose ability to enjoy all rights therefore is most in peril, must not be ignored by the measures aimed at achieving realisation of the right\u201d</b>.</p>\\n\\n<p>Although the Constitutional Court appreciated the applicants\u2019 argument that the research and training sites would provide further ongoing  data to establish the best prevention programme, the Court emphasised that there was no safety concerns about the drug and that the applicants\u2019 policy was not reasonable considering the exclusion vulnerable HIV pregnant women who do not have access to these specific sites.</p>","snippet":"","facts":"","decision":"","dissent":"","citedCases":[""]},{"id":"SoobramoneyvMinisterofHealthKwazuluNatal","href":"http://www.saflii.org/za/cases/ZACC/1997/17.html","title":"Soobramoney v Minister of Health (Kwazulu-Natal)","featured":false,"highlighted":false,"dateOfJudgment":"1997-11-27T00:00:00+00:00","courtName":"Constitutional Court","topics":["sec_27__Healthcare,_Food,_Water_and_Security"],"justicesConcurring":"Chaskalson P, Langa DP, Ackermann J, Didcott J, Goldstone J, Kriegler J,  Madala J, Mokgoro J, O\u2019Regan J, Sachs J","summary":"The appellant in this matter was a 41-year-old unemployed man who suffered from chronic renal failure. He required dialysis two to three times a week. Due to his financial circumstances he applied to a provincial State Hospital to receive the treatment. The Addington State Hospital however only had 20 dialysis machines available and because of the limited resources had a strict policy regarding access to renal dialysis and only patients that suffered from acute renal failure and were eligible for a kidney transplant were given access. Due to the nature of his illness, the appellant was denied treatment and he applied to the Durban High Court for an order directing Addington Hospital to provide him with ongoing dialysis and treatment and interdicting the Hospital from refusing him admission to the renal unit. The Durban High Court dismissed the application and the appellant urgently applied to the Constitutional Court to hear the matter.\\n\\n<p>The Constitutional Court had to decide whether the appellant, who suffered from chronic renal failure, had a right to receive ongoing renal dialysis from a State Hospital in terms of <b>section 27</b> and more specifically <b>section 27(3) of the Constitution</b> which provides that <b>\u201cNo one may be refused emergency medical treatment\u201d</b>.

The costs associated with extending renal dialysis to all patients in similar conditions would not be reasonable and the State would not be able to meet all its other constitutional obligations. Furthermore, Chaskalson P emphasised that the right not be refused emergency medical treatment  relates to the right to receive immediate medical attention and not to be turned away from a hospital which is able to provide the necessary treatment. The appellant needed renal dialysis two to three times a week and this did not constitute an emergency in terms of <b>section 27(3) of the Constitution</b>. The Constitutional Court therefore dismissed the appeal and held that there was no breach of the constitutional obligation resting on the State in this matter.</p>\\n\\n<p>This judgment provided clarity regarding the constitutional obligation resting on the State to provide everyone access to healthcare services in terms of <b>section 27 of the Constitution</b> and more specifically the obligation relating to <b>section 27(3) of the Constitution</b>. <b>Section 27(3) of the Constitution</b> provides that <b>\u201cNo one may be refused emergency medical treatment\u201d</b>. Chaskalson P writing for the majority emphasised that the right not to be refused emergency medical treatment essentially means that a person may not be refused immediate medical attention when they are experiencing a sudden medical emergency and cannot be denied ambulance services or be turned away from a hospital. In this matter the applicant suffered from a chronic renal failure and required dialysis treatment. The Constitutional Court held that this does not relate to an emergency calling for immediate remedial treatment.

The North Guateng High Court declared the relevant sections unconstitutional and therefore invalid. An application for confirmation of invalidity was launched before the Constitutional Court.\\n\\n<p>In a unanimous judgment, the Constitutional Court found that sections 15 and 16 of the Act were unconstitutional in that they infringed the rights of adolescents (12- to 16-year olds) to dignity and privacy, and further in that they violated the best-interests principle contained in <b>section 28(2) of the Constitution</b>. Relying on expert evidence, the Court concluded that the provisions criminalized what constituted developmentally normal conduct for adolescents, and adversely affected the very children the Act sought to protect. The effects of the provisions were found not to be rationally related to the State\u2019s purpose of protecting children.</p>\\n\\n<p>The provisions were declared invalid only to the extent that they criminalized consensual sexual conduct between adolescents.</p> \\n\\n<p>The Constitutional Court suspended the declaration of invalidity for 18 months to allow Parliament to amend the provisions.

Finally, the Minister was ordered to take the necessary steps to ensure that the details of any adolescent convicted of an offence in terms of sections 15 or 16 of the Act will not appear in the National Register for Sex Offenders and that such an adolescent will have his or her criminal record removed.</p>\\n\\n<p>The court held that in respect of whether the criminalization of consensual sexual conduct between children violated section 28 of the Constitution, it was necessary to firstly give content to section 28.</p>\\n\\n<p>The court observed that <b>section 28</b> is both a self-standing right and a guiding principle in respect of all matters affecting the child.

They had approached a company known as SA Multiloan in Stellenbosch for small loans. Later when they fell into arrears, the creditor provider demanded that they sign further documents which resulted in default judgments and emoluments attachment orders obtained by the credit providers. This allowed for the deduction of the judgment debt from their salaries or wages.\\n\\n<p>As a result of this, all the applicants approached the Law Clinic to institute proceedings in the High Court to have s65(J) declared unconstitutional. Their argument was that s65(J) allowed for emoluments attachment orders to be obtained without judicial oversight. The High Court agreed with them and declared the section unconstitutional and therefore invalid.</p>\\n\\n<p>Application was then filed to the Constitutional Court to confirm invalidity of s65(J). The majority judgment, written by Cameron J, disagreed with Jafta J\u2019s conclusion that it was possible to interpret s65J as providing for judicial oversight. S65J(2) licenses the issuing of an emoluments attachment order where the debtor consents in writing; or if \u201cthe court has so authorised\u201d. The conjunction \u201cor\u201d seems to make plain that an emoluments attachment order may be obtained through the debtor\u2019s written consent even when the court has not authorised it.</p>\\n\\n<p>Additionally, s65J(1) posits that a judgment creditor, not a court, causes an emoluments attachment order to be issued from a court. And once issued, s65J(5) provides that the order may be executed \u201cas if it were a court judgment\u201d. This wording allows for execution without judicial oversight. The majority judgment therefore concluded that the plain language of the provision shows it permitted judicially unsanctioned enforcement of judgment debts. Therefore, the section was unconstitutional.</p>\\n\\n<p>Zondo J concurred with the majority judgment but wrote separately. He took the view that in order for s65J(1)(a) to be read to mean that it is the court that issues emoluments attachment orders, one would have to read the phrase \u201cissued from the court\u201d to mean \u201cissued by the court\u201d. Zondo J held that there is no room for this interpretation.</p>\\n  \\n<p>The remedy adopted by Zondo J was supported by the majority. It was one of a combination of reading-in and severance and not the remedy adopted by the High Court. Accordingly, Zondo J did not confirm the order of constitutional invalidity made by the High Court, but rather ordered the reading-in, and severance of, certain words in section 65J(2)(a) and (b) in order to remedy the constitutional defect.</p>\\n\\n<p>Jafta J held that the High Court erred in proceeding from the premise that s65J(2) did not provide for judicial oversight without interpreting that section. He held that the Court was bound to determine for itself whether indeed the section failed to provide for judicial oversight.</p>\\n\\n<p>Jafta J held further that it should be determined whether the words \u201cfrom the court\u201d are capable of a meaning that accords with the assumed constitutional guarantee that, whenever execution is sought against one\u2019s property \u2013 regardless of whether movable or immovable \u2013 the execution must be subject to judicial oversight.</p>\\n\\n<p>Jafta J held that s65J indeed provides for judicial supervision. Therefore, assuming that the Constitution requires judicial supervision when emoluments attachment orders are issued, the section meets the requirement. Jafta J added that in these circumstances he cannot confirm the order of invalidity made by the High Court.</p>\\n\\n<p>The majority held that a debtor\u2019s section 34 right of access to court is breached when an execution process against any form of property occurs without judicial oversight of a court.</p>","snippet":"","facts":"","decision":"","dissent":"","citedCases":[""]},{"id":"ABandAnothervMinisterofSocialDevelopment","href":"\\nhttp://www.saflii.org/za/cases/ZACC/2016/43.html ","title":"\\nAB and Another v Minister of Social Development","featured":false,"highlighted":false,"dateOfJudgment":"2016-11-29T00:00:00+00:00","courtName":"Constitutional Court","topics":["sec_36__Limitations_of_Rights"],"justicesConcurring":"\\nNkabinde J [ Mogoeng CJ, Moseneke DCJ, Bosielo AJ, Jafta J, Mhlantla J and Zondo J] [majority]\\n\\nKhampepe J [ Cameron J, Froneman J and Madlanga J concurring ] [ minority] ","summary":"","snippet":"","facts":"","decision":"","dissent":"","citedCases":[""]},{"id":"FosevMinisterofSafetyandSecurity","href":"\\nhttp://www.saflii.org/za/cases/ZACC/1997/6.html ","title":"Fose v Minister of Safety and Security\\n","featured":false,"highlighted":false,"dateOfJudgment":"1997-06-05T00:00:00+00:00","courtName":"Constitutional Court","topics":["sec_38__Enforcement_of_Rights"],"justicesConcurring":"Ackermann J [Chaskalson P, Mahomed DP, Langa J, Madala J, Mokgoro J and Sachs J O\'Regan J] [majority]\\n\\nDidcott J and Kriegler J [separate concurring] \\n","summary":"The applicant stated that members of the South African Police Services violated his fundamental rights by widespread and persistent form of abuses including series of assaults and torture over a two day period. The applicant sued the Minister of Safety and Security for damages for pain and suffering, insult, shock, past and future medical expenses and loss of enjoyment of the amenities of life. He further sued for constitutional damages for the infringement of his constitutional right not to be tortured and not to be subject to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment and for infringements to his rights to dignity and privacy.\\n\\n<p>In this case the court considered whether to award damages/money to the applicant if there was a finding of wrongdoing by the government and violation of constitutional rights. Section 38 of the Constitution empowers a court to award \u201cappropriate relief\u201d, including a declaration of rights, where a right in the Bill of Rights has been violated. The applicant in this case successfully proved that he was  assaulted by members of the police therefore he would be awarded substantial compensatory damages  for pain and suffering, insult, shock, past and future medical expenses and loss of enjoyment of the amenities of life. The court then had to consider whether in addition to this award, the applicant should receive damages that are punitive in nature. That is, whether the court should award damages to the applicant which aim to punish or deter government from future similar acts.</p> \\n\\n<p>The court held that this question is answered on a case by case basis and when determining the answer to this question courts must look at the following; what relief will best ensure protection and enforcement of the constitutional rights and where necessary innovative remedies can apply, the relief must vindicate the infringed right and an appropriate relief may be achieved in the general claims of damages. In this case the court found that it would be inappropriate to award punitive constitutional damages in addition to the compensatory damages already awarded to the applicant. The court further held that damages against government would not have the intended impact of deterrence unless the money awarded was substantial in nature. The result of this would deplete already limited state resources and place the burden on tax payers. It would further be inappropriate where damages have already been awarded.</p>\\n\\n<p>In this case the court considered section 38 of the constitution which states that a court can award appropriate relief \u2018where a right in the Bill of Rights is violated, and what constitutes appropriate relief\u2019 The court found that the appellant succeeded in proving that he was indeed assaulted by members of the police therefore he would be awarded substantial compensatory damages  for pain and suffering, insult, shock, past and future medical expenses and loss of enjoyment of the amenities of life. Therefore his constitutional rights would be effectively vindicated without the awarding of constitutional damages. The court held that determining appropriate relief must be done according to the facts of the individual case. The relief must be one that effectively protects, enforces and vindicates the constitutional right which has been contravened. The court further held that courts will be required in certain instances to be innovative in ensuring that relief is achieved.</p>\\n \\n<p>The court further held that punitive constitutional damages awarded against the government would not have the intended impact of deterrence unless the money awarded was substantial in nature. The result of this would deplete already limited state resources and place the burden on tax payers. It would further be inappropriate where damages have already been awarded, therefore the punitive damages claim are dismissed.</p>\\n\\n<p>In the separate concurring judgement, Justice Didcott held that section 38 does not authorise punitive damages in this case. Future considerations of punitive damages similar to the one claimed in this case must be introduced by law and not through judicial innovation as suggested in the majority judgment.</p>\\n\\n<p>Justice Kriegler held that the vindication as mentioned requires special consideration. That the purpose of the section is to ensure that certain violations are addressed and if they are not, it will result in loss of faith in the constitution. The courts  must in exercising discretion to choose between appropriate forms of relief must carefully analyse the nature of a constitutional infringement  and the probable impact of a particular remedy. The facts surrounding a violation of rights will determine what form of relief is appropriate.</p>","snippet":"","facts":"","decision":"","dissent":"","citedCases":[""]},{"id":"CarmichelevMinisterofSafetyandSecurity","href":"\\nhttp://www.saflii.org/za/cases/ZACC/2001/22.html","title":"\\nCarmichele v Minister of Safety and Security","featured":false,"highlighted":false,"dateOfJudgment":"2001-08-16T00:00:00+00:00","courtName":"Constitutional Court","topics":["sec_39__Interpretation_of_Bill_of_Rights"],"justicesConcurring":"\\nAckermann J, and Goldstone J [Chaskalson P, Kriegler J, Madala J, Mokgoro J, Ngcobo J, Sachs J, Yacoob J, Madlanga AJ and Somyalo AJ] ","summary":"The applicant was sexually assaulted by a man who was awaiting trial for the attempted rape of another woman. Despite the seriousness of the alleged crime and the fact that the man had a prior rape conviction, the police and prosecutor had recommended that the man be released pending trial. The applicant sued the Minister for damages, arguing that the police and prosecutors had negligently failed to comply with a legal duty they owed to her to take steps to prevent the man from causing her harm. The High Court dismissed the applicant\'s claim and the Supreme Court of Appeal affirmed, holding that the police and prosecution did not owe her a duty of protection. The applicant sought relief from the Constitutional Court to determine whether the police and prosecutors owed a duty of care to a victim of sexual violence, and, if so, whether that standard of care was breached.\\n\\n<p>At issue in this case was whether the police or prosecutors owed a duty of care to a victim of sexual violence, and, if so, whether that standard of care was breached. The applicant argued that due consideration should have given prior to the release of the accused particularly given the prevalence of gender-based violence in South Africa, there should have been a special concern by the state as a constitutional obligation not to do anything that could further the possibility of violence. The respondent argued that the law stated that a mistake by a judicial officer that leads to bad consequences as in the applicants case can\u2019t be the basis for seeking damages in court. Further that the state did not have a \u2018duty of care\u2019 to someone in applicants position.</p> \\n\\n<p>The Court found that the police have positive obligations to protect the fundamental rights and freedoms contained in the Bill of Rights. The police, therefore, had to reasonably protect women from sexual violence, and their failure to do so would result in liability.</p>\\n\\n<p>The Court also emphasised South Africa\u2019s duty under international law to prohibit all gender-based discrimination. The Court noted that the police are one of the primary agencies of the state responsible for the protection of the public in general, and women in particular, against the violation of their fundamental rights by perpetrators of violent crime. The Court found that the police, therefore, had a duty to protect applicant and granted damages sought.</p>\\n\\n<p>The Court held that <b>section 173 of the Constitution</b> gives all courts the power to develop the common law in the interests of justice. <b>Section 39(2) of the Constitution</b> provides that when developing the common law, every court must promote the spirit, purport, and objects of the Bill of Rights. The Court held that where the law does deviate from this standard, the courts have an obligation to act. In deciding whether a duty of care existed in this case, the court looked to the relevant statutory provisions that imposed positive obligations on members of the police force to preserve freedom and security.</p>\\n\\n<p>The Court noted that in addressing such obligations in relation to dignity and the freedom and security of the person, \u201cfew things can be more important to women than freedom from the threat of sexual violence.\u201d  The Court held that the police is one of the primary agencies of the state responsible for the protection of the public in general, and women in particular, against the violation of their fundamental rights by perpetrators of violent crime. The court found that the police, therefore, had a duty toward the applicant and had breached that duty.
